                    <p>Experienced higher education professional and leader seeking a new career path in web
                        development. I have a Master’s degree in Educational Leadership from Northern Arizona
                        University. I also have a Web Development certificate completed in 2019 at the University of
                        Arizona. I work for an IT department at a university as a frontend web developer and business
                        analyst. I enjoy collaborating on ideas, and building, testing, and deploying tools and
                        applications with colleagues. I am skilled at speaking the language of the ‘tech-world’ and the
                        ‘world of education;’ I will be an asset to any organization seeking a liaison to bridge the two
                        areas via web development.

                    <h1>Read My Bio</h1>
                    <p>Hi everybody! My name is Max and I live in Tucson, AZ. I am an Arizona native and grew up in the
                        eastern part of the state. In my free time I like to watch baseball and follow the Boston Red
                        Sox, visit art museums, as well as hike, swim, and spend time with my nephews and
                        nieces.<br><br> I
                        completed studying full stack web development in July, 2019 and I love every minute of it. No
                        longer do I dread reading graduate-level theoretical text. Rather, I am eager to find free time
                        to work on applications to learn web development. They say it's not work if you love what you
                        do!<br><br> I enjoy working on enterprise software and educational technology. From 2012 - 2019,
                        I led
                        the charge for the SALT Center Application on campus. I was responsible for troubleshooting and
                        managing the technical functioning of the application. The application is a portal for new
                        students and the new student enrollment record. Each year, I evaluated the application and
                        administrative components.<br><br>I determined enhancement needs to streamline the
                        student-facing
                        experience and the application review business process. I began the process with thoughtful and
                        student-focused analysis with the Admissions team. I compiled the recommendations made during
                        discussions into Help Desk Tickets and then collaborated with SASG for implementation, testing,
                        and deployment. My application enhancement efforts contributed to a 21% new student
                        matriculation increase from Fall 2013 to Fall 2017. <br><br> I am an alumnus of the University
                        of Arizona
                        with a B.A. in Art History. I graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2016 with my
                        Master's Degree in Educational Leadership, CCHE (Community College and Higher Education).</p>
